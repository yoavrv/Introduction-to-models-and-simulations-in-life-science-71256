# Introduction to models and simulations in life science 71256 #

TA material for course 71256: Introduction to models and simulations in life science.  

The course was given  Autumn 2022, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, by lecturer Dr. Tamar Freidlander, with TA Yoav Ravid. The language of the course is Hebrew.

This repository includes Tutorials, Homework, and Additional Materials made by me (Yoav). Lecture notes belong to Tamar.

The course follows from the book "A Biologist's Guide To Mathematical Models in Ecology and Evolution". The tutorials are mostly dedicated to practical implementation of these concepts in Python.

## חומרים נוספים:

Additional materials: 
* html_tech.ipynb  
    Collections of useful though rudimentary html tags and techniques for making the hebrew notebooks. Inspired by the hebrew notebooks of ["לומדים פייתון"](https://github.com/PythonFreeCourse/Notebooks) (Github)  

* shift_and_scale.ipynb  
    a demonstration of shifting and scaling of functions and shapes

## תרגולים:  

Tutorials. Jupyter notebooks assume basic numpy+scipy+matplotlib+pandas environment in jupyer lab. 
1. Jupyter notebook and Pseudo-random numbers
2. Flow diagrams, scale and shift + reminder of Taylor series
3. Exponential and Logistic population models, Recursion equations.
4. Cobweb plots
5. Allee effect
6. Diploid selection, Affine equation of mRNA level.
7. Stochastic simulations
8. Wright Fisher and Moran processes
9. Moran Process and Object Oriented Programming
10. Numeric solution of Differential equations, SIR model
11. Lotka Volterra and phase space; Summary of stability in 1D  

These tutorials were made mostly on-the-fly during the course, with little preparation time or familiarity with the student existing Python knowledge, so they can use a re-work.  
Important aspects:
* Improve pedagogical quality: make sure the lessons are coherent, of short length, and match the students level in Python.
* If computer lab and more time are available, split sections for it.
* Standadizing the language to hebrew
* Make sure the notebooks work in VScode
* Can cobweb, recursion solver, WF simulation be rewritten or split to more digestible chunks?
